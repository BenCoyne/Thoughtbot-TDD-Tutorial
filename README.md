# Thoughtbot: Red-Green-Refactor by Example
## Fundamentals of TDD

This tutorial is a great introduction to Test Driven Development. Rather than use Rspec's autorun feature, I decided to run Rspec on the calculator_spec.rb file. 

You can find the tutorial here:

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and make sure you have Rspec installed:

`gem install rspec`
